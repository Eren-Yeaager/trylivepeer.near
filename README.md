## Getting started

To run locally, install packages:

```bash
pnpm run init
pnpm install
```

Then, run the command:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will serve the widgets from `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` and start a local gateway.

Also, don't forget to add API key in `.env`.

## Usage

You can run the local gateway with `yarn run start`, then open `localhost:3000/trylivepeer.near/widget/index`,
then navigate to the sandbox.

The goal of this project is to expose the below components through the Near Social VM, so that these keywords may be used in Widgets.
